# Environments

Two environments, and one rule that shapes everything else.

## Staging never holds real customer data

Not a copy, not a subset, not "just to reproduce this one bug". This is an HRIS:
the data is legal name, home address, salary, bank details, sickness and
parental leave, and some of it is [GDPR Article
9](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/) special-category data.

Staging gets synthetic data from `tools/scripts/seed-staging.ts`. If production
data is ever genuinely needed to reproduce something, it is anonymised first by
a script that lives in this repository and is reviewed like any other change —
not by an ad-hoc dump on somebody's laptop.

Separate databases, separate credentials and separate Vercel projects exist to
make the wrong thing hard rather than merely forbidden.

## What they are

|           | Staging                              | Production                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Deployed  | from a pull request, once `ci` green | from `main`, once `ci` green |
| Approval  | none                                 | required, on the environment |
| Tenants   | `<company>.staging.app.kithena.com`  | `<company>.app.kithena.com`  |
| Database  | Neon `staging` branch                | Neon `main` branch           |
| Data      | synthetic only                       | real customers               |
| Customers | test                                 | real                         |

```

                                                              └─ url on the PR

   └─ ci (14 checks) ──green──▶ approval ──▶ migrate production ──▶ deploy
                                                              └─ smoke test
                                                                 └─ fails? roll back
```

Both halves trigger on `workflow_run` after `ci` and refuse anything whose
conclusion is not `success`. A separate workflow cannot use `needs:`, and
without that guard either would deploy a commit whose tests failed.

**Migrations run before the deploy, never after.** Expand-contract means the new
schema is readable by the old code, so migrating first is safe. Migrating second
leaves a window where new code reads columns that do not exist yet.

## Rolling back

Production promotes the previous deployment when its smoke test fails. That is
seconds, where a revert-and-redeploy is minutes.

**The database is not rolled back with it, and there are no down migrations.**
The previous build reads the new schema perfectly well — that is what
expand-contract buys. Undoing the migration is what would break it. A bad
migration is fixed forward, by another migration, reviewed like anything else.

## One-time setup

### DNS, at Cloudflare

Cloudflare holds the zone and issues the wildcard certificate. Vercel cannot
issue one without controlling DNS, and moving DNS to Vercel would mean
recreating these same records there instead.

**Recreate these five before changing nameservers.** They carry
`info@kithena.com`, and the domain is where mail delivery is decided. Verify a
real message arrives before switching, not after.

| Type | Name                   | Value                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| MX   | `@`                    | `mx1.spacemail.com` (priority 0)                     |
| MX   | `@`                    | `mx2.spacemail.com` (priority 0)                     |
| TXT  | `@`                    | `v=spf1 include:spf.spacemail.com ~all`              |
| TXT  | `spacemail._domainkey` | `v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIIBIjANBgkq…` (see below)          |
| SRV  | `_autodiscover._tcp`   | `autoconfig.spacemail.com:443`, priority 0, weight 0 |

The DKIM value is long and must be copied whole; a truncated key fails
silently, in the sense that mail still sends and quietly starts failing
authentication. Read it back from the registrar rather than retyping it.

Two records also currently point the documentation sites at Vercel and need to
come across:

| Type | Name        | Value         |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| A    | `design`    | `76.76.21.21` |
| A    | `storybook` | `76.76.21.21` |

Then add the wildcards:

| Type  | Name            | Value                             |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| CNAME | `*.app`         | the Vercel project's alias target |
| CNAME | `*.staging.app` | the Vercel project's alias target |

### Postgres, at Neon

One project, two branches: `main` for production and `staging` for staging. The
staging branch is a copy-on-write fork, which is what makes resetting it cheap
enough to actually do.

**The application role must not be a superuser.** A superuser bypasses row-level
security unconditionally — `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` does not apply to it and
neither does `NOBYPASSRLS` — so tenant isolation silently enforces nothing. This
is not theoretical: it is the bug
`packages/db-kit/src/tenant.integration.test.ts` was written after hitting.

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#writing-a-row-level-security-policy) for the two
details every policy needs.

### Secrets

Per GitHub Environment, never repository-wide, so a job cannot read the other
environment's database by accident:

| Secret          | Staging                                        | Production         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`  | Neon `staging` branch                          | Neon `main` branch |
| `ATLAS_DEV_URL` | a throwaway database Atlas drops and recreates | same               |

`ATLAS_DEV_URL` must never point at the database being migrated. Atlas drops
everything in it to compute a diff.

## Local

`just dev` brings up the whole compose stack. Tenants resolve at
`<company>.app.localhost`, which most browsers send to `127.0.0.1` without a
hosts entry. `TENANT_HOST_SUFFIX` in `.env.example` is already set to match.
